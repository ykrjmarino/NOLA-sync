NOLA CRM → NOLA CRM Contact Sync Plan (Step-by-Step)
Objective: Automatically sync contacts from INTERN Account → NOLA EventPro CRM in the same agency when a contact is created or updated.

1.Prepare Private Integration
    Log in to INTERN Account
    Navigate to Settings → Private Integrations
    Click Create New Integration
    Fill in:
        Name: Account Sync
        Description: Optional
        Select Scopes needed for contacts:
            contacts.read → read contacts
            contacts.write → create/update contacts (optional for now)
    Save → you’ll get an Access Token 

This token will be used by your middleware to read contact data from Account 1
Note: For NOLA EventPro CRM, we will get a separate Private Integration Access Token later when sending data.

2.Make a workflow
Trigger: 
    Create Contact
    Update Contact

    Webhook (POST)
