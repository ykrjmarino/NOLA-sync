TO-DO:::
    run server.js
    ngrok --- change link in webhook workflow

Code by yourself
DO::
    use the fetched data from INTERN Account
    use the contact_id in post/put method

    if contact_id found, use PUT method to update
    if not, use POST method to create

use the last coding:
    postContacts
    putContacts


ps: 
    i think get contacts (plural) is deprecated in GHL API Documentation,, so use the contact_id to search a specific contact

    we use diff custom fields:: 
        para malaman kung aling contacts yung galing sa INTERN accounts
        para hindi fully mixed yung contacts from INTERN and NOLA EventPro CRM
        contacts from INTERN Account should have a separate group
        can't search NOLA contact_id because it assigns its own unique contact id
